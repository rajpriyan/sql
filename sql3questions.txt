1.In Employees_Projects table some rows reference employees who no longer exist in the employees table. Remove these orphaned rows

DELETE FROM employees_projects ep
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.id = ep.employee_id);

   (or)

Delete 
from employees_projects 
where employee_id not in (select salary from employees);

   (or)

DELETE ep
FROM Employees_Projects ep
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON ep.employee_id = e.id
WHERE e.id IS NULL;

2. Detect Salary gaps
hint: you want to compare the average salary between departments.

SELECT
    department_id,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
    (SELECT MAX(avg_salary)
     FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
           FROM employees
           GROUP BY department_id) AS department_avg_salaries) - AVG(salary) AS salary_gap
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY salary_gap DESC;


3. Employees working on more than 1 project
 
insert into employees_projects (project_id, employee_id) values (1,1);
 
Select e.id as employee_id, COUNT(ep.project_id) as project_count from employees e
JOIN employees_projects ep on ep.employee_id = e.id
GROUP BY e.id
HAVING project_count > 1;
